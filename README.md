# ECM3408-Assessment
Continuous Assessment for ECM3408 - Enterprise Computing, set by Prof. David Wakeling. Involves the use of a RESTful interface to implement a spreadsheet MVP as an SC microservice. 

This work received a mark of 92/100, although this may be subject to increase in the future.

### Prerequisites

### Usage

This submission includes this file and three other Python files. `sc.py` is the main program containing the Flask app.

The following instructions assume that you are trying to run the program on a Linux machine, with Python 3.6.8, flask and requests libraries, as well as standard libraries.

To run the program, please use either

```
python3 sc.py -r sqlite
```

or

```
python3 sc.py -r firebase
```

The option selected depends on whether you intend to have data stored in an Sqlite database, or a Firebase Realtime Database.

If using the latter option (Firebase), please ensure that you have a valid database name stored in an environment variable `FBASE`. This can be done using the following

```
export FBASE=<your database name here>
```

Please note that `sc.py` will not run unless the `-r` flag has been supplied, followed by one of the two above options provided.

`firebase_backend.py` can be run to clear any current data in a Firebase Realtime Database (assuming you've already exported the database name in this session). `sqlite_backend.py` can be run to test the database functions.
